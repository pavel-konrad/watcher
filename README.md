# Watcher â€“ Chrome Extension Prototype


**Watcher** is an experimental **Chrome extension** created as part of a "vibe coding" session.  
The idea was to explore how quickly a functional prototype can be built using a mix of  
AI-assisted prompting and manual coding.

---

## Project Goals
- Learn the basics of **Chrome extension development** (manifest, background scripts, UI).  
- Experiment with **AI-assisted coding workflows**.  
- Prototype a tool that monitors and organizes user activity.  

---

## Features
- Basic Chrome Extension setup with a `manifest.json`.  
- Background script handling simple events.  
- Minimal UI for testing extension logic.  
- Initial data handling for categorization.  

---

## Purpose
This project is not a production-ready extension.  
It is kept as an **early experiment** to document the learning process, the potential of  
AI-assisted prototyping, and to show how quick iteration can produce tangible results.

---

## Future Work
- Expand data handling and categorization.  
- Create a polished UI for user interaction.  
- Publish a working version to the Chrome Web Store.  

---

## Notes
This repository is intentionally left as an **open prototype**.  
It represents a hands-on exploration of coding with partial AI assistance ("vibe coding"),  
combined with traditional problem-solving and debugging.
